                    <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <h3>When it comes to the food truck experience, mobile technology has left it behind. There is no quick and easy way to find and order food from food trucks using mobile apps today. And most food trucks don’t have the time or resources for making that experience seamless for their customers. That’s where Paycrave comes in.</h3>

                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                  <h3>I was inspired by trying to understand the intricacies of ordering food from a mobile app.
                  <br><br>In my research, I found that 75% of customers do not visit food trucks regularly. However, 88% of all respondents said that they would definitely eat from them more if a mobile app made the process simpler and more enjoyable. 
                  <br><br>Finally, users said that <b>the biggest issues were waiting in line to pick up their orders and not being able to pay ahead when ordering.</b></h3>
               </div>
               <div class="solution-section">
                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                  <h3>The most important feature for an app like Paycrave, is the seamlessness of the ordering and payment process. Through user research and testing, I was able to refine these processes into a simple and enjoyable experience.
                  <br><br>In my testing, users responded overwhelmingly positive to the experience. Respondents said that the menu quantity selection, and payment information selection made the process enjoyable to use.
                  <br><br>The process of finding a food truck’s menu was further refined through user testing. From the original design of the menu button to the final design, we jumped up over 32% in success rates.
