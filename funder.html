                    <h3>The marketplace has a few large crowdfunding services that are quite popular. However, the vast majority of services give a poor user experience, and split up user causes. One large service mainly caters to products and projects, while another service focuses on social justice, medical expenses, and civic funds. Funder attempts to create a simple, and beautiful website that has no such limits.</h3>

                  <h3>I was inspired by trying to understand the intricacies of ordering food from a mobile app.
                  <br><br>In my research, I found that 75% of customers do not visit food trucks regularly. However, 88% of all respondents said that they would definitely eat from them more if a mobile app made the process simpler and more enjoyable. 
                  <br><br>Finally, users said that <b>the biggest issues were waiting in line to pick up their orders and not being able to pay ahead when ordering.</b></h3>
