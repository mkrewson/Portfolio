                    <h3>The marketplace has a few large crowdfunding services that are quite popular. However, the vast majority of services give a poor user experience, and split up user causes. One large service mainly caters to products and projects, while another service focuses on social justice, medical expenses, and civic funds. Funder attempts to create a simple, and beautiful website that has no such limits.</h3>

                <h2>The Problem</h2>
                  <h3>Looking into the crowdfunding and donation space showed me that there was still quite a bit left lacking in the market.
                  <br><br>In my research, <b>the majority of people donated only once a year or less.</b> Even then most people did not yet go to one service to handle all of these, but instead went to multiple websites to do this. 
                  <br><br>However, <b>most people like the simplicity of donating online and said that they were interested in a service covering all of those needs.</b></h3>

               <div class="solution-section">
                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                  <h3>The goal for a service like Funder is the simplicity and intentional design of a modern donation and crowdfunding service. With the help of <b>user testing and research</b> I was able to focus on these essentials.
                  <br><br>In my testing <b>users found the simplicity of Funder much more enjoyable than competitors sites.</b>

                 <h2>The Process</h2>
                   <h3>I created Funder from its inception to final designs. <b>A competitive analysis showed weaknesses in competitors offerings with segmented approaches to crowdfunding and donations.</b> <b>User surveys</b> gave greater insight into how users currently donate and participate in crowdfunding.
                   <br><br><b>User personas</b> were essential to understanding who would be using a service like Funder and what they needed in that service.</h3>

It’s resulted in a simple, modern, and beautiful crowdfunding service with no limitations.</b> In creating Funder, much was gained in understanding users behaviors and in my skills as a designer/researcher. Constant iteration from user testing resulted in a deliberate and intentional design. Based on my results, the prototype has received positive feedback for it’s simplified nature, and modern appeal.<br><br><br><b>If you didn't get a chance earlier, would you like to try a <a href="https://marvelapp.com/1j4e2hc" class= "prototype-link">desktop prototype?</a></b></h3>
