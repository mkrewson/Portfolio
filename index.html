        <h2>Here’s a little bit about me…</h2>
        <p>I have always had a passion for understanding the way humans interact with our world, and the things we humans create. Inspired by design giants, such as Dieter Rams and Jony Ive, I grew up being fascinated by intelligent and simple design. I began my journey with a Design Apprenticeship at Bloc. Since then, I have been immersed in the world of human-centered digital design. A few things I’m crazy about are coffee, travel, film, outdoor sports, more coffee, friends and family, but most of all my lovely wife.</p>
